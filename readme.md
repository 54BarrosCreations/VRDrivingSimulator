##Important notice

In the level *Open World* precomputed lightning and shadows have been disabled, and must be disabled when pushing the Level to Github. Github only allows 100MB large files and when enabling precomputed shadows the *Open World* level gets much larger than 100MB. The setting is called *Force No Precomputed Lightning* and is found under *World Settings* in the *Open World* Level. So when you want to run the simulator with shadows, make sure the setting is set to false and rebuild the project. And when you push to Github, make sure the setting is set to true and rebuild the project.
